    <p>
            In this task you will be asked to make a series of insurance decisions. For each
    decision, you will start off with an initial amount of money. You will then be presented
    with the probability and value of a potential loss, as well as the price of the insurance you
    could purchase to avoid that loss. You have to decide if you want to purchase the
    insurance that would protect you if that loss should occur. There are 20 such decisions to
    be made in this task. After all the decisions have been made, you will be paid according to
    the outcome of that event, so you should think carefully about how much the insurance is
    worth to you.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here is an example of what your decision would look like on the computer screen.

            In this lottery, there is a 10% chance you will experience a loss of twenty dollars
        ($20) that corresponds with the red portion of the pie, and a 90% chance you will
        experience no loss ($0) that corresponds with the green portion of the pie. Since you start
        out with $25, this means there is a 90% chance your earnings remain at $25, but there is a
        10% chance you will lose $20, which would leave you with $5.

        You are given the option to buy insurance to protect yourself against the potential
        loss in this lottery. You should decide if you want the insurance before you know if a loss
        will occur. In this example, the insurance will cost you $2.25. This is full insurance,
        meaning if you purchase the insurance and a loss should occur, the insurance will cover
        the full loss, and your net earnings will be your initial earnings of $25 less the price paid
        for the insurance ($2.25), which is $22.75. If you choose to purchase insurance and there
        was no loss you would still need to pay for the $2.25 insurance, and your net earnings will
        be $22.75.

        Each decision you have to make is shown on a separate screen on the computer.
        For each decision, you should indicate your choice to purchase, or not purchase the
        insurance by clicking on your preferred option, then clicking the "OK" button.
    </p>

    <p>
        You will be able to see the result of each individual decision you make after you click on the "OK" button.
    </p>

    <p>
            Whether or not you prefer to buy the insurance is a matter of personal taste. You
        may choose to buy insurance on some or all of your 20 choices, or none of the choices.
        The people next to you may be presented with different insurance prices, and may have
        different preferences, so their responses should not matter to you. Please work silently,
        and make your choices by thinking carefully about each prospect.
