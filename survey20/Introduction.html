    <h3>
        Rounds and Set-up of the experiment
    </h3>
    <p>

        There are two rounds in this experiment, round 1 and round 2. Each round has 20 tasks
        and you will have to make a decision within 45 seconds.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Instructions Task 1 : Choices Over Risky Prospects
    </h3>

    <p>
            This is a task where you will choose between prospects with varying prizes and
    chances of winning. You will be presented with a series of pairs of prospects where you
    will choose one of them. There are 20 pairs in the series. For each pair of prospects, you
    should choose the prospect you prefer to play. You will be paid based on
    one of the tasks that you perform in this experiment today, and you will be paid
        according to the outcome of that prospect, so you should think carefully about which prospect you prefer.
    </p>

    <p>
              Here is an example of what the computer display of such a pair of prospects will
    look like.
    </p>

    </div>


    <p>
           In the above example, the left prospect pays eight dollars ($8) with a 15% chance,
        i.e,  if the random number drawn is between 1 and 15 and is illustrated by the blue color
        in the pie chart. It pays $24 if the random number drawn is between 16 and 20 (5% chance),
        denoted by the color green. It pays $60 if the number drawn is between 21 and 100, which is shown by the color orange.

    </p>

    <p>
        Now look at the pie in the chart on the right.
        It pays thirty-three dollars ($33) if the number drawn is between 1 and 30,
        forty-two dollars ($42) if the number is between 31 and 40,
        and fifty-three dollars ($53) if the number is between 41 and 95
        and ninety-three dollars ($42) if the number is between 96 and 100.

    </p>



    <p>
            For instance, suppose you picked the prospect on the left in the above example. If the random number was 37,
        you would win $60; if it was 3, you would get $8. If you picked the prospect on the right and drew the number 37,
        you would get $42; if it was 3, you would get $33.


    </p>

    <p>
            Therefore, your payoff is determined by three things:
        1. by which prospect you selected, the left or the right, for each of these 20 pairs;
        2. by which prospect pair is chosen to be played out in the series of 40 such questions in total;
        3. by the outcome of that prospect.
    </p>


    <p>
            Which prospects you prefer is a matter of personal taste. The people next to you
    may be presented with different prospects, and may have different preferences, so their
    responses should not matter to you. Please work silently, and make your choices by
    thinking carefully about each prospect.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since there is a chance that any of your 20 choices could be played out for real,
        you should approach each pair of prospects as if it is the one that you will play out.

        After you have worked through all of the pairs of prospects, you will proceed to instructions for
        round 2.

    </p>

    <p>
                All payoffs are in cash, and are in addition to the $5 show-up fee that you
        receive just for being here, as well as any other earnings in other tasks.
