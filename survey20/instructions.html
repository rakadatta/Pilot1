    <h3>:
        Instructions Task 1 : Choices Over Risky Prospects
    </h3>

    <p>
            This is a task where you will choose between prospects with varying prizes and
    chances of winning. You will be presented with a series of pairs of prospects where you
    will choose one of them. There are 20 pairs in the series. For each pair of prospects, you
    should choose the prospect you prefer to play. You will be paid based on
    one of the tasks that you perform in this experiment today, and you will be paid
        according to the outcome of that prospect, so you should think carefully about which prospect you prefer.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here is an example of what the computer display of such a pair of prospects will
    look like.
    </p>
    <p>
        Insert  photo of the screen (middle of the screen): see page 1 of the .pdf
    </p>


    <p>
            In the above example the left prospect pays five dollars ($5) if the number drawn
    is between 1 and 40, and pays fifteen dollars ($15) if the number is between 41 and 100.
    The blue color in the pie chart corresponds to 40% of the area and illustrates the chances
    that the number drawn will be between 1 and 40 and your prize will be $5. The orange
    area in the pie chart corresponds to 60% of the area and illustrates the chances that the
    number drawn will be between 41 and 100 and your prize will be $15. When you select
    the lottery to be played out the computer will tell you what die throws translate into what
    prize.

    </p>

    <p>
        Now look at the pie in the chart on the right. It pays five dollars ($5) if the
    number drawn is between 1 and 50, ten dollars ($10) if the number is between 51 and 90,
    and fifteen dollars ($15) if the number is between 91 and 100. As with the prospect on the
    left, the pie slices represent the fraction of the possible numbers which yield each payoff.
    For example, the size of the $15 pie slice is 10% of the total pie.

    </p>



    <p>
            For instance, suppose you picked the prospect on the left in the above example. If
    the random number was 37, you would win $5; if it was 93, you would get $15. If you
    picked the prospect on the right and drew the number 37, you would get $5; if it was 93,
    you would get $15.


    </p>

    <p>
            Therefore, your payoff is determined by three things:
        1. by which prospect you selected, the left or the right, for each of these 20 pairs;
        2. by which prospect pair is chosen to be played out in the series of 40 such questions in total;
        3. by the outcome of that prospect.
    </p>


    <p>
            Which prospects you prefer is a matter of personal taste. The people next to you
    may be presented with different prospects, and may have different preferences, so their
    responses should not matter to you. Please work silently, and make your choices by
    thinking carefully about each prospect.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since there is a chance that any of your 20 choices could be played out for real,
        you should approach each pair of prospects as if it is the one that you will play out.

        After you have worked through all of the pairs of prospects, you will proceed to instructions for
        round 2.

    </p>

    <p>
                All payoffs are in cash, and are in addition to the $5 show-up fee that you
        receive just for being here, as well as any other earnings in other tasks.


    <h3>
        Instructions Task 3
    </h3>


    <p>
            In this task you will be asked to make a series of insurance decisions. For each
    decision, you will start off with an initial amount of money. You will then be presented
    with the probability and value of a potential loss, as well as the price of the insurance you
    could purchase to avoid that loss. You have to decide if you want to purchase the
    insurance that would protect you if that loss should occur. There are 20 such decisions to
    be made in this task. After all the decisions have been made, you will be paid according to
    the outcome of that event, so you should think carefully about how much the insurance is
    worth to you.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here is an example of what your decision would look like on the computer screen.
    </p>

    <p>
        Insert  photo of the screen (middle of the screen): see page 3 of the .pdf

    </p>


    <p>
            In this lottery, there is a 10% chance you will experience a loss of twenty dollars
        ($20) that corresponds with the red portion of the pie, and a 90% chance you will
        experience no loss ($0) that corresponds with the green portion of the pie. Since you start
        out with $25, this means there is a 90% chance your earnings remain at $25, but there is a
        10% chance you will lose $20, which would leave you with $5.

        You are given the option to buy insurance to protect yourself against the potential
        loss in this lottery. You should decide if you want the insurance before you know if a loss
        will occur. In this example, the insurance will cost you $2.25. This is full insurance,
        meaning if you purchase the insurance and a loss should occur, the insurance will cover
        the full loss, and your net earnings will be your initial earnings of $25 less the price paid
        for the insurance ($2.25), which is $22.75. If you choose to purchase insurance and there
        was no loss you would still need to pay for the $2.25 insurance, and your net earnings will
        be $22.75.
    </p>


    <p>
        Each decision you have to make is shown on a separate screen on the computer.
        For each decision, you should indicate your choice to purchase, or not purchase the
        insurance by clicking on your preferred option, then clicking the "OK" button.
    </p>

    <p>
        You will be able to see the result of each individual decision you make after you click on the "OK" button.
    </p>

    <p>
            Whether or not you prefer to buy the insurance is a matter of personal taste. You
        may choose to buy insurance on some or all of your 20 choices, or none of the choices.
        The people next to you may be presented with different insurance prices, and may have
        different preferences, so their responses should not matter to you. Please work silently,
        and make your choices by thinking carefully about each prospect.

    </p>
